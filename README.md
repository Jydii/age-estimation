# Age Estimation Detection System for Facial Images

This project presents the age classification of facial images using an anthropometric-based model. 

The proposed method consists of four main stages: image processing (image resizing and grayscale image), face detection, feature 
extraction, and age group classification. 

The feature extraction was performed with an understanding of face variations by age in humans. The age group classification was evaluated using the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifier. The facial images are classified into two groups (Adult and Child), and the performance of the system 
is measured based on accuracy and mean absolute error (MAE) of experiments performed on a subset of the all-aged-faces (AAF) dataset and the face and gesture 
recognition research network (FG-NET) dataset. 

The result shows that the test, train accuracy, and MAE are 91.43%, 92.77%, and 0.086, respectively, after using the proposed ninety-three (93) biometric 
ratios and applying principal component analysis (PCA) transformation to reduce dimensionality.
